                                             [7] Anthropic s AI technology is amongst the most capable and safe in the world. However, large language models are a
                                             new type of intelligence, and the art of instructing them in a way that delivers the best results is still in its infancy
                                             it s a hybrid between programming, instructing, and teaching. You will figure out the best methods of prompting our
                                             AI to accomplish a wide range of tasks, then document these methods to build up a library of tools and a set of
                                             tutorials that allows others to learn prompt engineering, as well as work with high value partners to directly solve their
                                             challenges.

                                             [8] Given that the field of prompt-engineering is arguably less than 2 years old, this position is a bit hard to hire for! As a
                                             result, we ask that you share with us a specific prompt engineering project on LLMs that you re proud of in your
                                             application! Ideally this project should show off a complex and clever prompting architecture or a systematic
                                             evaluation of an LLM s behavior.

                                             based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work

                                             [56] How we're different
                                             [57] We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on
                                             just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact            advancing our long-term goals of steerable,
                                             trustworthy AI       rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical
                                             science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're
                                             an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the
                                             highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core
                                             of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null
                                             results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research,
                                             and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
