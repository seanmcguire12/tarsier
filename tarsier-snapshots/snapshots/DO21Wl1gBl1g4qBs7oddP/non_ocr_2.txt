                                           [208] This training covers the properties of Silicon Carbide which change the way how an inverter is designed compared to Si-chips. With that
                                           in mind, we explain SiC specific degradation mechanisms and how to ensure that SiC devices survive in the application, considering
                                           these special failure modes, by applying the reliability tests Infineon developed. These are internally mandatory for SiC device
